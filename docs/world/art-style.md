# Art Style

![World environment mockup](../reference/mockups/world1.png)

- **Style:** Isometric pixel art — modern fidelity, not chunky retro. Slightly more pixelated than the reference mockup above.
- **Palette:** Dark, desaturated base with neon pops. Teal/cyan dominant, hot pink and red as accent colors. Wet-street reflections on ground surfaces.
- **Lighting:** Real-time dynamic lighting — sprites receive light rather than baking it into textures. Neon signs, explosions, and spells cast actual light into the environment.
- **Animation:** ~25fps sprite animation in the Diablo 2 tradition. Weighted, deliberate feel.
- **Bosses:** Large-scale pixel art enemies — the small player character scale makes oversized bosses highly readable and impactful.

## Camera & Perspective

- **Projection:** Fixed isometric.
- **Occlusion:** Any geometry that would obscure the player character (walls, roofs, structures) becomes transparent. The player is always visible.
- **No rotation or zoom** (fixed camera).
